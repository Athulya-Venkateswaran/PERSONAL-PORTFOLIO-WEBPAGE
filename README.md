*DESCRIPTION*: As part of my internship assignment, I have created a responsive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developed entirely on Visual Studio Code (VS Code). This project showcases my understanding of front-end web development principles, as well as my ability to design, structure, and style web content that is accessible and user-friendly across devices. Tools & Technologies Used are HTML5-HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the structure of the website. I used semantic HTML elements to improve readability, accessibility, and search engine optimization (SEO). Multiple pages such as index.html, about.html, projects.html, and contact.html are created to demonstrate navigation and content organization.CSS3-CSS was used for styling the pages. I implemented Flexbox and CSS Grid to design responsive layouts. Custom classes were applied for different sections like header, footer, skills list, and project cards to maintain a consistent and aesthetic look. Media queries were used for mobile responsiveness.JavaScript-JavaScript was incorporated to add interactivity to the website. A basic script in main.js is used to handle the contact form submission with an alert popup to simulate form feedback. While minimal, this demonstrates client-side scripting understanding.Visual Studio Code (VS Code)-This project was developed using VS Code, a lightweight but powerful source code editor. VS Code provided features such as live server extensions for real-time preview, Emmet for faster HTML and CSS writing, and Git integration for version control. Project features are Multi-page structure-The portfolio consists of multiple HTML pages—Home, About, Projects, and Contact—each linked through a navigation bar.Responsive Design-Using Flexbox and Grid ensures the layout adjusts seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.Project Showcase-The Projects page includes real-world projects with images, descriptions, and placeholder links for live demos and source code.Contact Form-A simple contact form is added with input validation using HTML attributes and submission handling using JavaScript.Resume Download-A resume download link is provided using the download attribute in the anchor tag. Styling Consistency-The design maintains a consistent color scheme and font styling across pages, creating a professional aesthetic. Applicability in Real-world Scenarios are freelancing web projects, job apllications, small business websites, learning showcase,etc. Skills Demonstrated are HTML & CSS structuring, Responsive design with Flexbox and Grid, JavaScript for basic DOM interaction, Navigation and multi-page linking, Form handling and user interaction, Working with media elements (images, PDFs), Visual consistency and theme planning.
